Hi, in this code I applied everything that I learned at the moment about react and am trying to explain it using my own words.How does the Age counter work? The logic is very simple, everytime you press the plus button it increments the variable used, then displays the incremented value, and whenever you press the substract button it decrements the value of the variable and later on be displayed, the reset button resets the variable by reverting its default value.
